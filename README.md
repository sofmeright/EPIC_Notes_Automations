# MHAC_Notes_Automations
A software I wrote to help with automating my job at a healthcare provider in my area. I am not employed or otherwise affiliated with Kaiser. This software is my code which I own. I do not own or posses the right to represent Kaiser Permanente, my work is not a reflection of their business practices. This software is provided as inspiration to all developers and Healthcare Organizations who may stumble accross this script. IMHO the workflow of most organizations is not very efficient or ergonomic. During this project I also developed code for automating EPIC. Much can be done and it isn't very hard. I hope this fuels a fire. I pray for change / implementation of software solutions with the focus of improving the patient experience and not lowing metrics and enforcing harsher standards on employees.
