# EPIC_Notes_Automations
A software I wrote to help with automating my job at a healthcare provider in my area. I am not employed or otherwise affiliated with Kaiser. This is my code, however I do posses the right to represent Kaiser Permanente, my work is not a reflection of their business practices. This software is provided as inspiration to all developers and Healthcare Organizations who may stumble accross this script. IMHO the workflow of most organizations is not very efficient or ergonomic. During this project I also developed code for automating EPIC. Much can be done and it isn't very hard. I hope this fuels a fire. I pray for change / implementation of software solutions with the focus of improving the patient/employee experience and while not raising metrics requirements and enforcing harsher standards on employees.

I am also releasing this with a GNU License. You have the right to repurpose/implement this software in ways that benefits patients. But if I hear of any of my code being used to abuse employees or be brief with patients who are needing support from their community I WILL take action. Be kind and courteous. Be good to others. We are all in this life together.
